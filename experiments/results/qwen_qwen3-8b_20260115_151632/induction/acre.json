      "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred metal cylinder \u2192 off\nyellow metal cylinder \u2192 on\nyellow metal cylinder, red metal cylinder \u2192 on\ngray metal cube, blue metal cylinder \u2192 off\nblue metal cylinder, blue rubber cube \u2192 off\ngray rubber cylinder, blue metal cube, blue rubber cube, blue metal cylinder \u2192 on\n\nNew test case:\ngray rubber cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?",
